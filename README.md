# AddressParser
## Information
*This project is a console application for reading and analyzing city directories in xml or csv format.
After launching, the application waits for entering the path to the directory file or the exit command. At the shutdown command, the application shuts down its work. After entering the path to the directory file, the application generates summary statistics:
1. Displays duplicate entries with a number of repetitions.
2. Displays how many in each city: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 storey buildings.
   After the statistics are output, the application again waits for entering the path to the directory file or the shutdown command.*
